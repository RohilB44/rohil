<h2 id="history" class="head"> The History of Video Games</h2>
    <div id="his"><p>Now that you know more about me and geners, lets dive in to the history of video games. Video games <strong>started in Japan</strong> with Atari Creating <em>Pong</em> Atari was a company that made many retro games which was later bought by hashbro. After words a lot of <strong>retro gaming studios</strong> popped most of them have been bough, but some still take jobs from companies, but haven't really been bought. The gaming industry started to <strong>grow with Nintendo</strong>,before Nintendo started developing games they were actually a card company that made playing cards.Nintendo first started with the NES including classic games like Zelda, Metroid, and more. Then Xbox and Playstation buily around the NES controller, so the controller you play with tday wether it be Xbox, or Playstation orginated from the NES. As time went on Nintendo grew to be to be the top video game company to this day, making <em>very complex games</em> like The legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.</p></div><br><br><br><br>
