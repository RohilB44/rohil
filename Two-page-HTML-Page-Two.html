    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="indent">I watch <strong>alot</strong> of anime, although it isn't as common as video games it's a pretty <em>worthy source of entertainment</em>. If you don't know anime stands for animation.Like Video games anime has many <strong>generes</strong>, but the only main difference is that it <em>isn't interactive</em> like video games. Usally, people think anime is weird because it's in a <strong>different language and other reasons</strong> but in reality it's actually <em>pretty good and fun to watch</em>. Anime actually start of as <em>manga or comics</em> in more understandable words, then as it progresses the series gets animated.</p>
    <h2 id="both">Anime and Manga</h2>
    <p class="indent">Like I have stated before, as aJapanese comics or manga progress and once the manga is seteled, and when the team thinks it's alright, it gets <strong>animated</strong>. Allthough some manga get <em>animated</em> when it is completed, some hits get <em>animated early</em>. Manga is <strong>fun to read</strong> allthough it can take a <em>bit longer to read</em> than it takes to watch anime, it's still good because somethings that are in the manga of the series can be taken away in the actual anime.Allthough it's more <strong>reliable to read the manga than watch the anime.</strong> As previously mentioned <em>manga and anime have generes too</em>, if they didn't have generes it would be <strong>hard to know what you are reading or watching.</strong> Now let me list a few bellow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Action/Adventure</li>
<p>Action/Adventure is basically what the name  states. The protagonist has to go around <em>search for an objective</em>. The protagonists are usally <strong>nomadic</strong> and they have a goal.</p>
<li>Shonen</li>
<p>Shoenen is a term not many people know, the Jappanese meaning means <strong>young boy</strong>. Like the meaning the shows are generally <em>made for young boys.</em></p>
<li>Shoujo</li>
<p>Just like Shonen it means young girl. These shows are usally meant for <strong>girls</strong>, and mosly have romance and love. The storeies usally have a <em>different style of drawing.</em></p>
<li>Iseakai</li>
<p>Isekai is a term used for anime that take place in <strong>multiple worlds</strong>. Sekai means world in Jappanese, so that is a big clue to it's meaning. Iseaki generally are action/adventure</p>
<li>Thriller</li>
<p>Thriller anime generally are <em>intense.</em> Just like  normal thriller you don't know whats goning to happen. Thriller anime are <strong>generally darker than usal anime.</strong>
</p>
</ul>
